But should not expect this much backup of you are using volume above 80%- Fits good in ears however, it depends on the ear size and shape of an individual also.- The buds do not fall down during any work or workout. Did not try them while jogging/running though.- Noise cancellation for calls is decent, even when it is not promised primarily. I spoke over a call for 3 hours and the call quality is good.Cons:- Volume levels are high, but not very high. With some Youtube videos, the volume levels will not be enough if you are in crowd.- Bass is average, cannot have high expectations. These are not in-ear buds, hence, you'll feel the bass is low.- due to smooth finish and improper shape of buds, it is difficult to take out the buds if your hands/fingers are big. They are also slippery.- Touch controls are not so easy to navigate and sometimes I should repeat the command twice or thrice to get them working. Maybe I'm not much habituated to this.- Touch commands are also different from other Noise/ear buds products, so getting confused when using them.- When adjusting the ear bud, the long tap on the bud activates Google Assistance unnecessarily.Overall, the buds are too good for this price range. I don't think you should expect anything more for this deal.Edit 1: After 6 months of usage. (June 2021)- The buds sometimes connect to the phone even when they are placed inside the charging case. I will be connected to a Bluetooth speaker and these buds connect out of nowhere and the music playing will be interrupted and changed to the buds immediately. At those times, I will have to mark the buds as forget device and then continue playing the music from speakers. This has become a headache. I feel like giving 1 star for this.- The white LED lights on each earbud and the charging case light are almost invisible in the daylight or under the sun.

I was pretty anxious before buying this but I guess it was the right choice ..Sound -Highs and Mids : Simply amazing and super clearLows or Bass : For a normal person this bass is more than enough and he/she will love them but if a musician, then the bass could have had been a little more .. although it is a lot already.Built Quality:Very Firm and luxurious quality in this budget .. a sweet briefcase like egg shaped casing with beautiful earsets.Comfort:Fits in appropriately and stays inside and specially even if you are a heavyweight person .. if you try to touch your cheek to your shoulder .. the normal pods usually pop out or fall down but this earpiece gets brilliantly adjusted and stays within though at times you may feel that they are a bit loose but they stay within the ear and do not fall out. At times when you press them in your ear for a more firm grip the bass quality increases and it sounds more better for Bass lovers.Charging and controls:Charging is great .. for the specifics read the number of hours but as I have been using them since last 2 weeks I have charged them only twice with almost 3 to 5 hrs usage in one day and charging takes 50 mins for full charge.From controls perspective if you need something very organised and clear like plus minus volume button and one single button for functionality then these may seem a bit finicky to you as the touch bit has pattern function- one touch two touch etc but if you're a science student who loves complications then these controls are for you plus you have to make sure that while adjusting these headphones in your ear hold them from the bottom so that it does not interfere with the touch function cz that gets annoying at a later stage.Call Range and Quality:Has a great range as mentioned and within that range the call quality is great and the individual on the receiving end can also hear you whispering on these.Noise Cancellation:Ofcourse they do not cancel the external voice completely like the In-Ear buds but that is what I needed as I don't feel comfortable in them and this was exactly what I was looking for and it does involve some external voice so that even while listening to music you can hear your mom shouting your name or the door bell but not when the volume is full or a level below full which is again a good thing in this product.Overall feedback : A Great product from my point of view and in their next update they should add more bass for the musicians out there.

5,5,5,5,Mridul,2022-07-09,No good experience with it,"I am writing this review after using it for more than 6 months. Mine got issues in 6 months having low volume in one of the ear pieces. So I went for warranty claim & that was seemless. Initially I was quite impressed with the warranty claim process. I got the repaired product within a few days.This is where the issue started. I got an old repaired unit which has battery issues. Both ear pieces sound were corrected but battery drains in 3-4 min. So I asked for warranty claim again and they refused it by saying you can only claim it once. I told them that you sent me a defective product then they agreed to repair it too.I received repaired product second time the old used product and boom. This is another defective item. Now, sound were okay, battery is working fine but both ear pieces do not sync with each other. You can only use one at a time & there's a pause for 1-2 sec. in every 10-12 sec. play.I do not trust this brand now and do not recommend it at all. It's like gambling. If you are lucky your product will work otherwise it's waste of money.

I bought a Noise TWS (airbuds). Its noise cancellations was poor, battery backup was miles below than claimed by them. Connecting to the phone took time than it should take. And, after few months its battery drained very fast and I lodged a complained to the call center. They took away the TWS from me and after around 22 days, they had returned me a different pair which was used by someone and its battery was worse than the previous one! I complained again but their call center is so pathetic that you won't get a chance to talk to their customer care executive in your lifetime. If you get, then you must be extremely lucky, I could not get through them even after trying more than 12 times.Then I twitted the matter but their reply from everyone was that they would not let me go as unhappy customer! But they never bothered to contact me. I twitted them 3 times and their response was same.  In the mean time the warranty got over and they said that they can not service me because the warranty has expired! Even if I had lodged the complaint long before the expiry of the warranty, they would not bother to continue on the same complaint number. Finally, I gave up and bought a TWS from Boult at 50% of the price of that of Noise and to my utter astonishment I found it better in terms of battery and noise cancellation than that of Noise. Finally, I bought a pair of Apple airpods and so far both of the Boult and Apple Airpods are working fine.
",0,1,"this is a genuinely experienced review from a customer who is cheated by this fraud company. i bought a noise tws (airbuds). its noise cancellations was poor, battery backup was miles below than claimed by them. connecting to the phone took time than it should take. and, after few months its battery drained very fast and i lodged a complained to the call center. they took away the tws from me and after around 22 days, they had returned me a different pair which was used by someone and its battery was worse than the previous one! i complained again but their call center is so pathetic that you won't get a chance to talk to their customer care executive in your lifetime. if you get, then you must be extremely lucky, i could not get through them even after trying more than 12 times.then i twitted the matter but their reply from everyone was that they would not let me go as unhappy customer! but they never bothered to contact me. i twitted them 3 times and their response was same.  in the mean time the warranty got over and they said that they can not service me because the warranty has expired! even if i had lodged the complaint long before the expiry of the warranty, they would not bother to continue on the same complaint number. finally, i gave up and bought a tws from boult at 50% of the price of that of noise and to my utter astonishment i found it better in terms of battery and noise cancellation than that of noise. finally, i bought a pair of apple airpods and so far both of the boult and apple airpods are working fine.
